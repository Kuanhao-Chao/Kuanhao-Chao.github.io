# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Also read `AGENTS.md` (contributor workflow, style, commit/PR norms, list of one-time local scripts) and `README.md`. This file focuses on architecture and avoids repeating them; keep all three in sync when behavior changes.

## What this is

Astro 7 static site for the personal academic website `khchao.com` (Kuan-Hao Chao). No client-side UI framework — content is Markdown/MDX in typed content collections, rendered to static HTML and deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. Node 22 (`.nvmrc`).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server at http://localhost:4321.
- `npm run check` — `astro check` (TypeScript + content-schema validation). **Primary correctness gate; there is no unit-test suite.**
- `npm run build` — `astro build` then `pdf:posts`. Needs Playwright Chromium (run `npx playwright install chromium` once on a new machine).
- `npm run pdf:posts` — regenerate per-page PDFs from an existing `dist/` (requires a prior build).
- `npm run audit:indexing` — post-build SEO/indexing invariant checker (see below). Run after `npm run build`.
- `npm run audit:posts` — Playwright-driven visual/behavioral audit of interactive post animations (`scripts/audit-post-ui.mjs`): boots a preview server, drives chromium+webkit across desktop/phone × light/dark, and checks figure zoom, animation playback, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and print output against a per-post `inventory` of expected animation/figure counts. Update `inventory` when a post's interactive component count changes.
- `npm run audit:security` — static scan (`scripts/audit-security.mjs`) over `src/`, `public/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, and config files for `target="_blank"` without `rel=noopener`, plain-`http://` links, hardcoded secrets, unsanitized `set:html`/`innerHTML` sinks (outside an allowlist), iframe issues, privacy leaks, missing `noindex` on invite pages, and `javascript:`/`data:` protocol usage. `npm run audit:security:live` additionally fetches the live site to check response headers.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built site.

There is no "run a single test"; validation is whole-repo (`check`, plus `audit:indexing`/`audit:posts`/`audit:security` after a build).

## Architecture

### Content collections are the source of truth
All page content lives in typed collections under `src/content/` — `publications`, `presentations`, `research`, `teaching`, `news`, `posts`, `reports`. **`src/content.config.ts` defines and validates every frontmatter field; read it before adding or editing any content entry.** Filenames are lowercase slugs (often date-prefixed); the slug becomes the URL. List/detail pages in `src/pages/` call `getCollection(...)` and render via `src/components/`; dynamic detail routes are `src/pages/<section>/[...slug].astro`.

### Identity, navigation, and design are centralized
- `src/data/site.ts` — name, role, bio, nav menu, social links, and the structured `identity` facts used for JSON-LD. Most components read from here.
- `src/data/cv.ts` — CV data (experience, education, honors, …).
- `src/styles/tokens.css` — the design system (colors, fonts, type scale, spacing). Change the design here, not in per-component styles.

### The scholar / SEO / indexing pipeline (the most load-bearing subsystem)
`posts` (blog) and `reports` (technical reports) are "academic document" sections that share machinery making them discoverable by Google Scholar and rich-result crawlers. Five files move together:
- `src/lib/scholar.ts` — builds `citation_*` meta and reference strings.
- `src/components/BaseHead.astro` — emits Person + WebSite JSON-LD on every page, plus Google Scholar `citation_*` tags and `noindex` when passed `scholarMeta` / `noindex`.
- `src/pages/posts/[...slug].astro` and `.../reports/[...slug].astro` — build per-entry `ScholarlyArticle` + breadcrumb JSON-LD and thread `scholarMeta` through `EntryLayout` → `BaseLayout` → `BaseHead`.
- `scripts/gen-post-pdfs.mjs` — prints each built page to a `<slug>.pdf` with Playwright (one PDF per entry, kept ≤5 MB for Scholar by capping image resolution).
- `scripts/audit-indexing.mjs` (`npm run audit:indexing`) — asserts every invariant of the above against `dist/`: sitemap membership, canonical, robots meta, visible h1/abstract/references, citation meta, `ScholarlyArticle` JSON-LD, and PDF presence/size/extractable text. **This is the regression test for the whole subsystem — run it whenever you touch the head, the slug pages, the PDF script, or report privacy.**

### Reports are in private launch — gated off in several coordinated places
A report builds a live URL + page but stays hidden until deliberately published. The gate is enforced redundantly, and `audit:indexing` fails if the pieces disagree:
1. `src/content.config.ts` — `reports` schema defaults `unlisted: true` (→ per-page `noindex`, no citation meta, no PDF link).
2. `astro.config.mjs` — sitemap `filter` excludes the entire `/reports/` subtree.
3. `scripts/gen-post-pdfs.mjs` — `shouldSkipPdf` skips report PDFs entirely.
4. `public/robots.txt` disallows `/reports/`; the `/reports/` index page is `noindex`.

To take a report public, change **all of these in concert** (set `unlisted: false`, narrow the sitemap filter, allow its PDF, relax robots/audit). The audit script encodes the current "whole section private" state, so publishing requires updating it too — don't relax one place in isolation.

### Other non-obvious things
- **Math (KaTeX)** is wired in `astro.config.mjs` (`remark-math` + `rehype-katex`) for the LaTeX-heavy reports; the report slug page imports `katex/dist/katex.min.css` so both the page and its printed PDF typeset math. Posts currently use no math.
- **Cross-links between sections** use `relatedPosts` references in frontmatter, resolved by `src/lib/relatedPosts.ts` into "Blog" chips on publication/research entries.
- **`src/legacy-redirects.mjs` is generated** by `scripts/gen-legacy-redirects.mjs` — edit the generator, not the data file. The LiftOn `v2 → v1-0-9` redirects in `astro.config.mjs` are intentional; don't "fix" them.
- `public/` is served verbatim; `src/assets/` images are optimized at build via `astro:assets`. Keep `public/CNAME`, `astro.config.mjs` `site`, and SEO metadata all pointing at `khchao.com`.
- `scripts/audit-security.mjs` maintains a `SAFE_SET_HTML_FILES` allowlist of components that legitimately use `set:html` (mostly the animated figure components, e.g. `src/components/LiftOn*.astro`, `OpenSpliceAI*.astro`, `Shorkie*.astro`, `Splam*.astro`, `WGT*.astro`). Add a new component to this list if it needs `set:html` for inline SVG/animation markup; otherwise the audit fails it as an unsanitized sink.
